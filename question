1. ## What do you love most about computing?

I love computing because it provides endless opportunities for problem-solving and innovation. The process of breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and then building a solution from scratch is extremely satisfying. Computing empowers me to create tools, applications, and systems that can improve people's lives or enhance businesses. I enjoy the constant learning curve in this field, with new technologies and frameworks emerging regularly, which challenges me to grow and stay up to date. Ultimately, computing is not just about writing code but about creating meaningful solutions that have a tangible impact.
2. ## If you could meet any scientist or engineer who died before A.D. 2000, whom would you choose, and why?

I would choose to meet Alan Turing. As one of the pioneers of computing and artificial intelligence, Turing's work laid the foundation for modern computer science. His development of the Turing machine theory was revolutionary, and his efforts during World War II, including breaking the Enigma code, saved countless lives. Despite the challenges he faced, Turing's resilience and groundbreaking contributions to mathematics, computing, and cryptography have always inspired me. Meeting him would be an incredible opportunity to discuss the future of computing and gain insights into his thought process and vision.
